# Football Prediction App - Status
Last Updated: Oct 15, 2025, 11:06 PM

## Progress: 60% Complete (6/10 phases done)

### What Works:
- Data loading from CSV files ✓
- Feature engineering (1045 features) ✓  
- Model training (6 XGBoost models) ✓
- Prediction API infrastructure ✓

### Current Problem:
Predictions show unrealistic probabilities (99.7% draw) because:
- Training creates 1045 features
- Prediction creates 659-701 features (mismatch!)
- Missing features filled with 0 = garbage predictions

### Files to Fix:
1. `python_api/services/predictor.py` - feature mismatch issue
2. `python_api/services/model_manager.py` - goals model filename bug

### Test Command:
cd /var/www/html/pyethone/scripts/bet2/python_api
python predict.py "Manchester City" "Liverpool"


### Next Steps:
1. Fix feature consistency between training and prediction
2. Test with teams from training data
3. Build web GUI (Phase 8)
4. Admin panel (Phase 9)
5. Final testing (Phase 10)
