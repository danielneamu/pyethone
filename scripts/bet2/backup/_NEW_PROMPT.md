I'm continuing development of a football match prediction app from the previous session. Here's the context:

**Project:** Machine learning football prediction system (Premier League)
- **Tech:** Python (XGBoost/RandomForest) + PHP API + Bootstrap GUI
- **Status:** Production-ready v1.0 with full prediction pipeline
- **Location:** `/var/www/html/pyethone/scripts/bet2/`

**What's Working:**
✅ 212-feature ML pipeline with opponent intelligence
✅ Predictions for match result, goals (O/U), BTTS, cards
✅ Ensemble models (51% accuracy on match results)
✅ Web GUI with certainty scoring (margin-based)
✅ Data scraper automation

**Recent Updates:**
- Changed "confidence" to "certainty" (margin-based calculation)
- Standardized hyperparameters in config.py MODEL_PARAMS
- Fixed all data leakage concerns
- Added admin panel for data updates/retraining

**Files Uploaded:**
All core Python/PHP/JS files with .txt extension (see KEY_FILE_LOCATIONS.md)

**Models NOT Uploaded:**
Trained .pkl files are 20+ MB. Will retrain with:
cd /var/www/html/pyethone/scripts/bet2/python_api
python train_ensemble.py # Match + goals models
python train_cards.py # Cards models

**Next Priority:** [Choose one based on NEXT_STEPS.md]
1. **Database & Prediction Tracking** - Store predictions, track accuracy
2. **Multi-Competition Support** - Add La Liga, Serie A, etc.
3. **Batch Predictions** - Predict full matchweek at once

**Questions:**
1. Show me current project status
2. Help me implement [chosen priority]
3. What files need to be restored/created first?

**Available Files:** [List uploaded .txt files]

Let's pick up where we left off!
